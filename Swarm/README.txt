While creating this game I wanted the player to feel strong and overpowered, at the same time I also wanted a game that requires skill such as fast reaction in order to control the power they are given.
The game I made is a top down shoot em up arcade style game where the player's goal is to survive and kill as many enemies as possible in order to achieve a high score.

NOTE: Game should be played at a 4:3 resolution (1400 x 1050 should be the highest)
